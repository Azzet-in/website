          As part of its services, Azzet may make available the Pool(s) on the
          Azzet platform. A ‘Trading Floor’ is a specialised set of securities
          of a stock exchange. Eg - NIFTY 100 (India) Trading Floor will contain
          the top 100 securities (based on market capitalisation) from National
          Stock Exchange, India. Depending upon the circumstances of each
          Trading Floor, the participants can edit their portfolios till the
          official start time as declared in the Pool(s) details or adjusted
          deadline, as specified below. Azzet reserves the right to abandon a
          specific Pool or adjust the deadline of a Pool in certain specific,
          uncertain scenarios, which are beyond Azzet’s reasonable control.
          Azzet shall endeavor to send communications through emails and/or SMS
          communication, about any such change as is contemplated in the
          aforementioned paragraphs to keep the User updated. Portfolios are
          awarded points on the basis of the real life performances of the
          securities at the end of the designated time frame of the Pool(s). The
          Participant(s) whose Portfolios(s) have achieved the highest aggregate
          score(s) in the Pool(s) shall be declared winners ("Winners"). In
          certain pre-specified Pools, there may be more than one Winner and
          distribution of prizes to such Winners will be in increasing order of
          their Portfolio’s aggregate score at the end of the designated Pool(s)
          of the Pools. Currently, there are paid versions of the Pool(s) made
          available on Azzet platform. Users may participate in the Pool(s) by
          paying the pre-designated amount as provided on the relevant Pool
          page. The ‘pre-designated amount’ means and includes pre-determined
          platform fee for accessing Azzet services and pre-determined
          participant'’s contribution towards prize money pool. The Participant
          with the highest aggregate points at the end of the pre-determined
          time frame shall be eligible to win a pre-designated prize which is
          disbursed out of prize money pool, as stated on the relevant Pool(s)
          page. A Participant may create different Portfolios for participation
          in Pool(s) in relation to a Trading Floor across the Azzet Services.
          However, unless Azzet specifies otherwise in relation to any Pool
          ("“Multiple Entry Pool"”), Participants acknowledge and agree that
          they may enter only one Portfolio in any Pool offered in relation to a
          Trading Foor. In case of Multiple Entry Pool(s), a Participant may
          enter more than one Portfolio in a single Multiple Entry Pool. In
          addition, it is expressly clarified that Azzet may, from time to time,
          restrict the maximum number of Portfolios that may be created by a
          single User account (for each format of the Pool) or which a single
          User account may enter in a particular Multiple Entry Pool, in each
          case to such number as determined by Azzet in its sole discretion.
          Participant shall pay a pre-designated amount for participating in the
          Pool(s) being created on the Azzet platform. In the event a

          participating in a Pool(s) hereby authorize Azzet to appoint a third
          party/ Trustee/Escrow Agent to manage users funds on users behalf.
          Public Pool: In the Public Pool format of the Pool(s), Azzet may make
          available the Pool(s) comprising of 2 – 100 Participants or any other
          pre-designated number of Participants. Azzet may create this format of
          the Pool(s) as a paid format and the Winner will be determinable at
          the end of the Pool as per rule of the Pools. The number of
          Participants required to make the Pool(s) operational will be
          pre-specified and once the number of Participants in such Pool(s)
          equals the pre-specified number required for that Pool(s), such
          Pool(s) shall be operational. In case the number of Participants is
          less than the pre-specified number at the time of commencement of the
          Pool, such Pool(s) will not be operational and the pre-designated
          amount paid by each Participant shall be returned to the account of
          such User without any charge or deduction. In certain Pools across the
          Azzet Services, designated as “Confirmed Pools”, the Pool(s) shall
          become operational only when a minimum of two users join a Confirmed
          Pool. The pre-specified number of winners to be declared in such
          Pool(s), even if all available Participant slots (as pre-specified in
          relation to the Pool(s)) remain unfilled. It is clarified that
          notwithstanding the activation of such Pool(s), Participants can
          continue to join such Pool(s) till either (i) all available
          Participant slots of such Pool(s) are filled or (ii) the Pool to which
          the Pool (s) relates commences, whichever is earlier. In the event of
          shortfall in the number of participants joining the Confirmed Pool,
          Azzet shall continue with such Pools and the short fall in the prize
          pool shall be borne by Azzet. Public Pool: In the Private Pool format
          of the Pool(s), Azzet enables Users to create a Pool ("“Private
          Pool"”) and invite other users, whether existing Users or otherwise,
          ("“Invited User"”) to create Portfolios and participate in the
          Pool(s). Users may create a Private Pool to consist of a pre-specified
          number of Participants, that is, consisting of either 2 -100
          Participants. The User creating the Private Pool shall pay the
          pre-designated amount for such Private Pool and thereby join that
          Private Pool and shall supply a name for the Private Pool and be
          provided with a unique identification code ("Pool Code") (which will
          be issued to the account of such User). The User agrees and
          understands that once the Private Pool is created no change shall be
          permitted in the terms or constitution of the Private Pool, except for
          a change in the name of the Pool. The User creating the Private Pool
          shall provide Azzet with the email address or contact no. of Invited
          Users to enable Azzet to send a message or mail inviting such Invited
          User to register with Azzet (if necessary) and participate in the
          Private Pool in relation to which the invite has been issued. In order
          to participate in the Private Pool, an Invited User shall input the
          Pool Code associated with the Private Pool and pay the pre-designated
          amount for the Private Pool. Once the number of Participants in a
          Private Pool equals the number of pre-specified Participants for that
          Private Pool, the Private Pool shall be rendered operative and no
          other Invited Users or Users shall be permitted to participate in the
          Private Pool. In the event that any Private Pool does not contain the
          pre-specified number of Participants for that Private Pool within 1
          hour prior to the commencement of the Pool/Pool, the Platform will
          initiate an automatic refund of the amount deposited. Such refund
          shall be processed after the expiry of the deadline for filling of
          participants for such Private Pool. It is clarified that the
          participation of Invited Users in any Private Pool is subject to the
          pre-specified number of Participants for that Private Pool, and Azzet
          shall not be liable to any person for the inability of any Invited
          User to participate in any Private Pool due to any cause whatsoever,
          including without limitation due to a hardware or technical
          malfunction or lack of eligibility of such Invited User to participate
          in the Pool(s).

          User’s accounts towards the pre-designated amount of such user shall
          be debited from the User’s ‘Credits’ Account and thereafter, any
          remaining amount of participation fee shall be debited from the User’s
          Winning Account. In case there is any amount remaining to be paid by
          the User in relation to such User’s participation in any Pool(s), the
          User will be taken to the designated payment gateway to give effect to
          such payment. In case any amount added by the User through such
          payment gateway exceeds the remaining amount of the pre-designated
          amount, the amount in excess shall be transferred to the User’s
          ‘Credits’ Account and will be available for use in participation in

          Azzet. Azzet shall effect an online transfer to the User's bank
          account on record with Azzet within a commercially reasonable period
          of time. Such transfer will reflect as a debit to the User's Winnings

          issuance of such Bonus at any subsequent period in time nor create an
          expectation of recurring issue of such Bonus by Azzet to such User.

          him/her eligible to receive such amount. Subject to the provisions of
          a) above, the applicable Inviter Bonus earned by the Inviter shall be
          credited to the Inviter's Bonus Account within fifteen (15) days of
          the completion of the paid pool or Pool in which Invitee has used the
          Invitee Bonus or within fifteen (15) days of the Inviter completing
          the relevant step verification process, as the case may be. In the
          event that the Inviter fails to complete any of the verification steps
          within the Verification Period or omits to provide documents requested
          for such verification, the Inviter shall not be eligible to earn the
          applicable Inviter Bonus. It is clarified that the Inviter will be
          eligible to receive the Inviter Bonus with respect to any Pools or
          Pools only in the event the winners are declared for such Pools or
          Pools only. In the event that the Pool entry amount paid by the
          Invitee is refunded to the Invitee with respect to any paid pool or
          Pool, for any reason, the Inviter shall not be eligible to receive any
          Inviter Bonus for such Pool or Pool. The Bonus Amounts credited to the
          Inviter/Invitee can be used by the Inviter/Invitee to join cash Pools
          and Pools offered by Azzet through the Platform. No part of the Bonus
          Amount may be used to join private Pools or be withdrawn or
          transferred to any other balance account held by the Inviter/Invitee
          with Azzet or to any third party account or to any bank/payment
          instrument account. The deposit of the Bonus Amount shall be at the
          sole discretion of Azzet and shall be subject to the
          Inviter’s/Invitee’s compliance with these Terms. Azzet may substitute
          or change the Bonus Amount offered under the Program at any time
          without notice. An Inviter/Invitee may not substitute the amount of
          Bonus Amount or substitute offering for other items or exchange for
          cash. Azzet reserves the right to : withhold the deposit of the Bonus
          Amount; and/or forfeit any deposited Bonus Amount to an
          Inviter/Invitee or any prizes/winnings earned by the participant by
          using such Bonus Amount; and/or deactivate the accounts of the
          Inviter/Invitee, in the event that it determines or reasonably
          believes that such Inviter/Invitee has violated these Terms or the
          terms and conditions of the Azzet. Mere participation in the Program
          does not entitle the Inviter/Invitee to receive any Bonus Amount.
          Azzet may, at its sole and absolute discretion, disqualify any
          Inviter/Invitee if such Inviter/Invitee engages in or it is found that
          such Inviter/Invitee has engaged in any illegal, unlawful or improper
          conduct (with regard to the Program or otherwise). The decision of
          Azzet will be final and binding with regard to the Program, and the
          deposit of the Bonus Amount and no correspondence, objection,
          complaints, etc. will be entertained in this regard. This Program
          cannot be clubbed with any other Pools/promotions/programs that are
          running simultaneously and organised or conducted by Azzet. Azzet
          reserves the right to change/modify/or withdraw the Program and/or
          change these terms and conditions without any prior notice of the same
          at its sole discretion. The Terms and Conditions, as applicable to the
          Azzet's games and services, will apply to and govern the Program.
          Azzet does not make any commitment, express or implied, to respond to
          any feedback, suggestion and, or, queries of the participants
          (Inviter/Invitee) of the Program. Notwithstanding anything contained
          herein, the aggregate liability of Azzet to a participating
          Inviter/Invitee in relation to the Program for any reason whatsoever
          shall not exceed Rs.50.
